openHAB - "empowering the smart home" - vendor and technology agnostic open source home automation

The builds on F-Droid have FCM and crash reporting removed and therefore won't be able to receive push notifications from openHAB Cloud. Instead, notifications are polled on a regular basis in these builds.

openHAB este o platformă open-source bazată pe Java, care integrează şi combină o gamă largă de diferite sisteme inteligente şi tehnologii într-o singură soluţie.
Deasupra nivelului unificat de abstractizare sunt disponibile toate dispozitivele pentru motorul de automatizare bazat pe reguli și diferite interfețe de utilizator.
